==== Motivation to Participate
// please describe briefly why you participated

Space Applications Services has been developing a platform named ASB (for Automated Service Builder) for several years now. It has started before the draft Exploitation Platform Open Architecture was published and thus also before the Testbed-13 took place.

ASB has a mechanism to dynamically deploy Docker container images and run processes pre-installed in these containers in cloud environments. The actual deployment of the containers is delegated to Marathon (which relies on Mesos for the selection of the target worker nodes) and each container runs its own lightweight WPS service.

During the Hackathon, we have implemented a client component that dynamically generates an Application Package using the information we have in database (including processes, inputs/outputs, datatypes), then interacts with the WPS interface of the ADES implementations to deploy the application and trigger the executions.

The key differences between the Marathon-based and the ADES-based implementations are:

* With Marathon, deployed containers run a pre-installed WPS service that exposes ("offers") one or more arbitrary processes. After the deployment through Marathon, the client must communicate directly with the containers to execute the actual processes.

* With ADES WPS, deployed containers run arbitrary code as soon as they are started. After the deployment through the ADES, the client must still communicate with the ADES to execute the actual processes (newly added in the ADES offerings).


During the Hackathon, the new client component has been tested against the ADES implemented by Thales Alenia Space and 52°North.

==== Implemented Solution
// please describe your implemented solution here. Provide as much detail as you think reasonable.

The ASB core component in charge of requesting the deployment of the process/application images and their execution is the Tasks Manager. As most of the other ASB core components, it is implemented in the Python scripting language. It uses the WPS client package provided by the open-source library OWSLib (https://github.com/geopython/OWSLib/) to communicate with WPS servers.

===== Added support for WPS 2.0.0 in the client library

The WPS client package of OWSLib does not support the WPS 2.0.0 interface standard. The initial task has thus been to add basic support for WPS 2.0.0 to OWSLib, at least to be able to successfully communicate with the ADES implementations for deploying, undeploying and executing applications, both in synchronous and asynchronous modes.

===== Added support for ADES in the ASB Tasks Manager

====== Dynamic generation of the Application Package

The ASB Tasks Manager is generic in the sense that it is meant to be able to deploy any containerized application into any execution environment, provided it is given the appropriate adapters. At run-time, the component receives the necessary inputs for executing the application. Information necessary for deploying the application is retrieved from its database.

Because the application packages have a fixed format, the choosen lightweight solution was to use a template to automate their generation. The Python-based template engine Jinja2 uses the template document (see below) and the application properties (example on the next pages) to render the final application package. Please note that not all the possibilities have been implemented in the template. For example, it does not support process parameters of type Bounding Box nor nested inputs.

====== Interactions with the ADES WPS Interface

When the ASB Task Manager receives an execution request from the workflow engine, it fetches the definition of the process, its input and output parameters, and the data types from its database and generates the Application Package document.

The component then verifies that the application is not already deployed in the ADES (using the configured process title string). If so, it is not deployed again. If not, the DeployProcess process is executed (synchronously) and provided with the Application Package. When the deployment is complete, the client verifies that the application is now listed in the WPS offerings.

The component then generates a process Execute request and sends it to the ADES. This execution is asynchronous. A GetStatus request is issued at regular interval. When the execution is complete, a GetResult request is issued to obtain the outputs.

The ASB Task Manager executes the UndeployProcess process on the ADES to remove the application from its offerings.


==== Proposed Alternatives
// if you have any recommendations on other solutions, please describe them here

==== Experiences with AP & ADES
// please describe your experiences with the Application Package and the Application Deployment and Execution Service here.

The generation of the Application Packages did not pose specific problems. The EP Application Package E.R. is detailed enough to understand how the applications metadata must be encoded as Atom feeds.

The integration of the client component with the ADES of Thales Alenia Space has required some adaptations on both sides. The main incompatibilities are listed hereafter:

* The DeployProcess and UndeployProcess processes did not have the expected title.
* The UndeployProcess input parameter did not have the expected identifier.
* The DeployProcess implementation was expecting a non-empty process abstract string (even though it is optional in WPS 2.0.0).
* The application was expecting two inputs: "Input Image" and "Output Path". Because the first parameter can only receive the path to a single image, the application had to be executed several times, once for each image in the AOI.
* The Application Package was expecting an extra attribute for specifying the actual command to be executed within the Docker container. This attribute has been hardcoded for testing purpose.

==== Other Impressions & Recommendations
// whatever other impressions, recommendations etc. you have, please put them here

Application Packages

* The extra attribute required by the Thales implementation of the ADES is an easy way to prepare generic Docker images (only including the SNAP toolbox in this case) and dynamically providing the command to be run at execution time. This is similar to preparing a generic Docker image using a Dockerfile without "CMD" instruction and providing the command dynamically using docker-compose or on the commandline.

* Providing Catalogue information an OpenSearch query string as input may not be the appropriate solution for most of the applications. This removes from the client the control over the exact set of images to be processed by the ADES.

ADES

* The Thales application accepts a single image path per execution. This forces the client to implement a mechanism that executes the application once for each image and collects the results. An application that accepts a list of paths and executes the process on each entry in the list could be a solution in this particular case. However this is not considered generic enough. What is missing is a way to indicate in the AP which of the process inputs receives a list of entries that may be processed independently.

* The WPS 2.0.0 service that implements the ADES collects Job Identifiers that are then listed automatically in the GetCapabilities responses (as possible values for the JobId input parameter of the GetStatus and GetResult operations). By default, nothing prevents a client to get the status and then the results of any of the listed jobs.

==== INSTRUCTIONS

[NOTE]
.Instructions
===============================================
This section explains some concepts frequently required by Asciidoc novices. Please use this file as a template for your own clauses.
===============================================

===== Figures
If you want to reference a figure by using a figure number, it is important to use the following syntax. The figure identifier for <<img_mindMap>> is the first statement of the header. Please adapt the width as appropriate.

[#img_mindMap,reftext='{figure-caption} {counter:figure-num}']
.High-Level Mind Map of Testbed-14
image::images/t14MindMap.png[width=800,align="center"]

It is important that you use the same syntax for all images, otherwise the automatic numbering is corrupted!

===== Tables
Tables are easy to deal with as long as you keep them simple! To add a table, please use the following syntax.

[#table_countries,reftext='{table-caption} {counter:table-num}']
.Countries in Europe
[cols="50e,^25m,>25s",width="75%",options="header",align="center"]
|===
|Country | Population | Size

| Monaco
| 36371
| 1.98

| Gibraltar
| 29431
| 6.8
|===

The first line is used for referencing. You can reference <<table_countries>> in your text. The only thing you should change in that line is the table id, which is "table_countries" in this case. Please do not remove the "#", please do not change anything else in that line.

You can define the style and width of each column. In our example, the first column takes 50% of the entire width, the second and third column take 25% each. The total width of the table is 75% of the text width.

The letters after the width percentage indicate if the column is e=emphasis, m=monospaced, a=asciidoc, s=strong. The d=default does not need to be set.

Cell alignment: If you need to align a column, you may indicate this by setting ^,<, or >. Examples:

* ^25m = centered, 25% width, monospaced.
* >25e = aligned right, 25% width, emphasised
* <25 = aligned left, 25% width, asciidoc

In any case, please make sure that your table fit on a piece of A4 or letter-size paper!!

===== Recommended Asciidoc Environment
We recommend to use http://asciidoctor.org[asciidoctor] and http://asciidoctor.org/docs/convert-asciidoc-to-pdf/[asciidoctor-pdf] in combination with the https://atom.io[Atom] editor.

In Atom, you should install the following packages:

* asciidoc-preview
* autocomplete-asciidoc
* language-asciidoc
* markdown-writer: requires changing of key-map to allow for keyboard shortcuts such as e.g. *bold*
* platformio-IDE-terminal

This environment allows you to use keyboard shortcuts, autocomplete, syntax highlighting and a rendered preview for asciidoc; and provides you an terminal window within the editor to convert your asciidoc to html and pdf.

===== Asciidoc Conversion
In order to achieve a uniform look-and-feel of all ERs in both HTML and PDF, we have provided a css and theme file. The following commands can be used to convert the ER:

*Command for PDF output:*
 asciidoctor-pdf -a pdf-stylesdir=resources -a pdf-style=ogc -a pdf-fontsdir=resources/fonts -o 18-xxx.pdf  er.adoc

*Command for HTML output:*
 asciidoctor -a data-uri -a stylesheet=ogc.css -a stylesdir=./resources/stylesheets -o 18-xxx er.adoc

===== Source Code

You can add code snippets using the following syntax:

.Code Example XML
[source,xml]
----
<section>
  <title>Section Title</title> <!--1-->
</section>
----
<1> This notation allows to reference particular sections within the code.


.Code Example JSON
[source,json]
----
{"menu": {
  "id": "file",
  "value": "File",
  "popup": {
    "menuitem": [
      {"value": "New", "onclick": "CreateNewDoc()"},
      {"value": "Open", "onclick": "OpenDoc()"},
      {"value": "Close", "onclick": "CloseDoc()"}
    ]
  }
}}
----

===== Asciidoc(tor) Syntax Help
Is available e.g. here: http://asciidoctor.org/docs/

===== Citations
Please use the following syntax to insert citations:
